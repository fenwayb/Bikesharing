# Overview
<p> For this project we were tasked with using Tableau to analyze and display statistics regarding New York City's Citibike program for the purpose of potentially starting a similar buisness in another city.

# Results

<p>This viz shows the length of rides in minutes and hours. The large majority of rides are under an hour in length </p>

<p> This viz further expands on the previous one by seperating those ride lengths by gender. It can be seen that male riders make up a large portion of the rides. Women and people with unassigned genders seem to ride slightly longer than men but it is a negligible difference </p>

<p> This viz shows the average times that rides are end by the weekday. There is a clear trend of the 8-5 workweek making up a large portion of the bike usage, with afternoon rides mainly being a weekend activity. People also seem less likely to bike home from work on Wednesdays</p>

<p> This viz further expands on the previous one by seperating those stoptimes by gender. Males continue to make up a larger portion of the rides. </p>

![slide 5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106105597/193333741-9a84da7c-a2a6-4f9a-b094-eb7c870e7c79.png)

<p>This viz uses Tableau's dashboard mechanic to combine three visualizations together. The User Trips by Gender by weekday from the assignment is then further expanded upon with the Customer Type breakdown and the Gender Breakdown made in the module. Together this confirms the previous beliefs that males during the work week make up the majority of the riders. This also shows that those males are predominantly subscribed as well instead of being a one-off customer. Interestingly, those with an "unknown" gender are almost exclusively one-off customers and not subscribers.</p>

# Summary
<p> What can be gleened from this report is that the primary demographic of the Citibike program are men during the 8-5 work week, with a smaller secondary market of weekend afternoon riders. this service could benefit from expanding their female market. Now knowing who and when people usually use the bikes, the next thing to find out is where they primarily stop and start. Visualizations of where the bikes normally stop and start as well as a visualization comparing those to the the average time and day those bikes are checked out could be a useful addition. I believe the work week hypothesis could be further confirmed seeing bikes often checked out in the living areas and returned in the work districts in the morning, and reversed in the evening. I'd be curious to see where the weekend rides often check in and out. </p>
